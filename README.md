# recipe-app
Created By: Kelly Hodges, Branislav Todorovic, Vickie Vien

This is a recipe app in which a user can create, share, and search recipes. 
We are going to import files from the Spoonacular API to add to the recipe database so users can not only share and search recipes created by other users, but also search recipes from Spoonacular. 

The two models we will be working with are users and recipes. 

Duties:

***Kelly: recipe controller & recipe model ? ++
***Branislav: users controller, users model ? ++
***Vickie: views folders, public files, front-end

WHAT IS NEEDED IN README:
A README.md file with a link to your hosted app, explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
