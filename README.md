⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅* At least one non-User model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅* Your non-User model is connected to the User that created it
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅* A git repository not inside the class repo.
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅* At least one GitHub commit per day.
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅* Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku.
